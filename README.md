### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1.	AJAX – Ajax allows client web pages to quickly exchange data with a web server.
    Additionally, it doesn’t even necessitate a reload of the webpage.
    Ajax relies on the use of a programming language such as JavaScript as well as a 
    data interchange format. There are some limitations when using Ajax. For instance,  
    requested data can be located on a third-party server, however,
    not all web servers or browsers support this.  
2. 	JSON – JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It’s a syntax for the storing 
    and exchange of data. It’s a lightweight data interchange format, and a subset of JavaScript.
    Additionally, it’s language independent and self-describing, therefore easy to understand. 
3.	AJAX Security – AJAX-based web apps use the same security procedures as most web applications. 
    You must specify authentication, authorization, and data protection requirements. Client-side, 
    JavaScript is visible to the user, and hackers may use JavaScript to exploit server-side weaknesses.
